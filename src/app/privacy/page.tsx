        <H2>Introduction</H2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website. This Privacy Policy explains practices
          regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that is
          received. My primary goal is to showcase my work and skills through
          this website while respecting your privacy.
        </p>
        <H2>Information Collected</H2>
        <p>
          As my website is a static portfolio, I do not actively collect
          personal data from visitors. No account creation is required, and no
          cookies are used for tracking or personal data collection.
        </p>
        <H3>1. Log Files</H3>
        <p>
          Like many other websites, I collect information that your browser
          sends whenever you visit my site (&quot;Log Data&quot;). This Log
          Data may include information such as your computer&apos;s Internet
          Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address, browser type, browser version, the
          pages of my site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the
          time spent on those pages, and other statistics.
        </p>
        <H3>2. Contact Information</H3>
        <p>
          If I provide an option for you to contact me via email or a contact
          form, any information you provide is voluntary and used solely to
          respond to your inquiries.
        </p>
        <H2>Use of Information</H2>
        <p>The information I collect is used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
          <li>To ensure the proper functioning of the website </li>
          <li>
            To improve the website based on the information and feedback I
            receive from you{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            To respond to your customer service requests and support needs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <H2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</H2>
        <p>
          I do not sell, trade, or rent users&apos; personal identification
          information to others. I may share generic aggregated demographic
          information not linked to any personal identification information
          regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted
          affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
        </p>
        <H2>Security</H2>
        <p>
          The security of your Personal Information is important to me, but
          remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
          of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <H2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</H2>

          This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 2024 and will remain in
          effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the
          future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this
          page. I reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at
